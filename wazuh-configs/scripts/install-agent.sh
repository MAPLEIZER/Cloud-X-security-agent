# Cloud-X Security - Wazuh Agent Installer for Linux

# This script is a placeholder for the Linux agent installation.
# Future development should add logic for:
#   - Detecting the package manager (apt, yum, etc.)
#   - Downloading the correct Wazuh agent package
#   - Installing the agent
#   - Configuring the agent with the manager IP
#   - Starting the Wazuh agent service
